VERSION or DATE: 05/08/2011
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run the main method from the Battleship class
AUTHORS: Kyle Harrison
USER INSTRUCTIONS:

-Run the program from the Battleship main method to start and access the Main Menu GUI.

<--- Main Menu ---> 

Once the main menu loads you can select the option of starting a new game, loading the previous game save
viewing the rules or exiting the system.

<--- Start Game ---> 

When start game is selected, click yes to ensure you want to start a new game
Please allow between a few seconds up to 30 seconds for the program to run and generate new random locations.
If it has no loaded after 1 minute, restart the program as this may be due to an error. 

If shot selection appears, then the game is ready to play. Select your number of shots, either 75,50 or 25.
This will allow you to customise the difficulty of the game. Less shots will make it harder to hit each of the targets.

Select okay when the game is loaded to start and Gameboard will appear.

<--- Gameboard ---> 

When gameboard appears. Click on each part of the grid to fire a shot. If the same grid location is fired upon, 
your shot will be wasted. The grid will update to provide a visual representation of the grid and where shots have hit and fired.
If a shit is hit, an explosion sound and image will be displayed, otherwise a splash sound and a splash image will be displayed on that grid location

This continues until either you run out of shots or all ships have been destroyed completely.

<--- Game over ---> 

Either the lose screen or win screen will be displayed depending upon the results of the game.
Each will allow you to return to the main menu to replay or retry depending upon which choice you want to make.
The second option is to exit the program and end the game there.

If retry or repeat is selected, go back to start of read me and continue to end.
